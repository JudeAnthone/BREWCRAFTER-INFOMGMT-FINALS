✅ What to Build First (Recommended Order)
1. 🧱 Main Layout (Topbar + Sidebar)
All pages will sit inside this layout.

Do first:
Create a reusable AdminLayout.tsx in components/layouts/

Include:

Sidebar with links to all pages

Topbar with profile/settings/logout (can be mock for now)

A content area for routing

You'll wrap all your pages with this later.

2. 🛣️ Routing
Ensure all pages are connected and show inside the layout.

Do next:
Set up routes in router.tsx

Use React Router DOM to route each page

Test that you can navigate using Sidebar

3. 📊 Dashboard Page
This is the "home" or overview page.

Do:
Add placeholder cards or charts:

Total Orders

Sales Today

Top Product

Recent Orders (dummy data)

Use basic Tailwind cards or shadcn/ui components

4. 📦 Orders Page
This will later show a list of customer orders.

For now:
Add a table with mock data: order ID, customer name, status, total.

Add filter dropdowns (e.g. status: pending, completed).

Use @/types/ to define mock Order type.

5. 🍔 Menu Manager Page
For managing menu items (drinks & food).

Do:
Display a table or card list of menu items.

Add mock buttons: Edit, Delete, Add Item (open modal).

Add dummy categories: drinks, food.

6. 📦 Inventory Page
For tracking ingredients or stock levels.

Do:
Table layout with:

Ingredient name

Quantity

Unit (e.g., ml, pcs)

Status (In Stock / Low)

Add simple color indicators for low stock.

7. 👥 Customers Page
See registered customers (for loyalty points or history).

Do:
List of users with email, name, join date.

Can just be a dummy table for now.

8. ⚙️ Settings Page
Profile, password change, business settings.

Do:
Mock user profile section

Form fields (non-functional for now):

Business name

Email

Password

Save button

⏳ After All Pages Are Setup:
You can then:

Add reusable components (Card, Table, Modal)

Centralize styles and buttons into components/ui

Add types into types/index.ts

Move constants/mock data into lib/ or utils/
